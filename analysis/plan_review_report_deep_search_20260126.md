# Plan Review: Dyp Research & Dokumentsøk - Geoteknikk & Miljø

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED

## 1. Structural Integrity
- [x] **Atomic Phases**: Phases (Identification, External Search, Local Dive, Reporting) are logical and sequential.
- [x] **Scope Control**: Tightly focused on locating specific missing documentation ("dagsenter" settlement damages).

## 2. Specificity & Clarity
- [x] **Action-Level Detail**: Specific search terms ("dagsenter", "setningsskader") and targets are defined.
- [x] **No "Magic"**: The process relies on standard tools (`search_file_content`, `google_web_search`) and manual analysis.

## 3. Verification & Safety
- [x] **Automated Tests**: N/A for a research plan (manual verification is appropriate here).
- [x] **Manual Steps**: Clear success criteria (e.g., "Identifisert adressen").
- [x] **Rollback/Safety**: No code changes, so no rollback risk.

## 4. Architectural Risks
- None. This is a passive information-gathering operation.

## 5. Recommendations
- Proceed with execution. Ensure findings are carefully documented in the final report.
